# 👋 Hi, I’m Jon

Building reliable productivity tools that reduce friction and scale with real-world use.

I’m a software engineer focused on creating systems that automate busywork, improve workflows, and behave predictably in production. I enjoy working across frontend, backend, and infrastructure to ship tools that people actually rely on.
